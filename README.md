# LinearReg_with_NeuralNetwork
An implementation of a shallow deep learning neural network using linear regression for image classification

This is a basic skeleton for implementing linear regression with neural networks... just as a basic introduction to deep
learning.

***To test out the data set, please do your own dataset [^-^]***

The data set should have the dataset of images which you want to classify as. For example. if you want to classify cats,
upload the dataset of cat images.
